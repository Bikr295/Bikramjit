This code snippet is specifying the CSS properties for an image element with the class "home". Let's break down what each property does:

width: 1366px; - Sets the width of the image to 1366 pixels.
height: 483px; - Sets the height of the image to 483 pixels.
margin-top: -37px; - Moves the image 37 pixels up from its default position.
animation-iteration-count: infinite; - Specifies that the animation should repeat infinitely.
animation-name: open; - Refers to the keyframe animation named "open".
animation-duration: 6s; - Sets the duration of the animation to 6 seconds.
Now, let's take a look at the keyframes animation:

@keyframes open { - Defines a keyframe animation named "open".
50% { - Specifies the styles at the midpoint of the animation.
background-image: url('img10.jpg'); - Sets the background image of the element to 'img10.jpg' at the midpoint of the animation.
width: 1366px; - Keeps the width of the image at 1366 pixels.
height: 483px; - Keeps the height of the image at 483 pixels.
} - Closes the keyframe.
In summary, the code sets initial dimensions and positioning for an image and applies a continuous animation named "open" where the image's background image changes halfway through the animation. The animation is set to loop infinitely and lasts for 6 seconds.
